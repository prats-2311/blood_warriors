# Authentication System Redesign Requirements

## Introduction

The current authentication system uses a hybrid approach that mixes Supabase Auth with custom backend endpoints, creating complexity and potential security issues. This redesign will implement industry-standard authentication patterns with proper separation of concerns, enhanced security, and better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standardized JWT-Based Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent JWT-based authentication system, so that the application follows industry standards and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a JWT token with standard claims (sub, iat, exp, iss)
2. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL return a JWT access token and refresh token
3. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens using standard middleware
4. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh token mechanism
5. IF a JWT token is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 2: Secure Registration Process

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a secure and straightforward registration process, so that I can create an account safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
3. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link
4. WHEN a user clicks verification link THEN the system SHALL activate the account
5. IF email already exists THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
6. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL create user profile and type-specific records atomically

### Requirement 3: Secure Sign-In Process

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want a secure sign-in process with proper error handling, so that I can access my account safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return JWT tokens and user profile
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return generic error message
3. WHEN a user fails login 5 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account
4. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN the system SHALL log the login event
5. IF account is not verified THEN the system SHALL prompt for email verification

### Requirement 4: Token Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want proper token management, so that user sessions are secure and properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times (15min access, 7day refresh)
2. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL rotate both access and refresh tokens
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the refresh token
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL invalidate all user tokens
5. IF a token is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide token revocation mechanism

### Requirement 5: Password Security and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure password management and recovery options, so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets a password THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements
2. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send secure reset link via email
3. WHEN a user resets password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions
4. WHEN a user changes password THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
5. IF password reset link expires THEN the system SHALL reject the reset attempt

### Requirement 6: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper session management, so that my login state is maintained securely across browser sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
2. WHEN a user closes browser THEN the system SHALL maintain session based on "remember me" option
3. WHEN a user is inactive for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data
5. IF multiple sessions exist THEN the user SHALL be able to view and revoke them

### Requirement 7: API Security and Middleware

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent authentication middleware, so that all protected endpoints are properly secured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens
2. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses
3. WHEN user permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests
5. IF CORS is misconfigured THEN the system SHALL reject cross-origin requests

### Requirement 8: User Profile Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to seamlessly integrate with my profile data, so that I have a unified experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL return complete profile information
2. WHEN profile is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state
3. WHEN user type changes THEN the system SHALL update JWT claims accordingly
4. WHEN account is deactivated THEN the system SHALL invalidate all tokens
5. IF profile data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prompt for completion

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN suspicious login attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs without exposing sensitive data
5. IF security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails

### Requirement 10: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want clean authentication hooks and context, so that I can easily manage user state in React components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user state changes THEN the React context SHALL update automatically
2. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic refresh
3. WHEN refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN tokens SHALL be automatically attached
5. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with retry logic
