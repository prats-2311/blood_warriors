# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Personalization System integrates LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities with Qloo's taste intelligence API to provide personalized experiences for both patients and donors in the blood donation platform. This system transforms generic interactions into tailored experiences by leveraging user interest data to provide contextual responses and rewards.

The system consists of two main components: an Empathetic Companion for patients that provides personalized emotional support and suggestions, and a Donor Perks Program that rewards donors with interest-based coupons and incentives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Patient Interest Collection and Storage

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to provide my interests and hobbies during registration or profile setup, so that the system can provide me with personalized support and suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient accesses their profile settings THEN the system SHALL display an interface to input and manage their interests
2. WHEN a patient submits their interests THEN the system SHALL store them in the patients.taste_keywords field as a JSON array
3. WHEN a patient updates their interests THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update the database record
4. IF a patient has not provided interests THEN the system SHALL prompt them during their first chat interaction

### Requirement 2: Empathetic Companion Chat Enhancement

**User Story:** As a patient, I want the chatbot to understand my interests and provide personalized responses, so that I receive more relevant and comforting support during difficult times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient sends a message to the chatbot THEN the system SHALL retrieve their taste_keywords from the database
2. WHEN constructing the LLM prompt THEN the system SHALL include the patient's interests as context
3. WHEN the LLM generates a response THEN it SHALL incorporate the patient's interests into personalized suggestions
4. WHEN a chat interaction is completed THEN the system SHALL log the conversation in the chathistory table
5. IF a patient has no stored interests THEN the system SHALL provide generic but empathetic responses

### Requirement 3: Donor Interest Management

**User Story:** As a donor, I want to specify my interests and preferences, so that I can receive personalized rewards and incentives that match my tastes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a donor registers or updates their profile THEN the system SHALL allow them to input their interests
2. WHEN donor interests are submitted THEN the system SHALL store them in the donors.qloo_taste_keywords field
3. WHEN a donor views their profile THEN they SHALL be able to see and modify their stored interests
4. IF a donor has not provided interests THEN the system SHALL prompt them after their first donation

### Requirement 4: Qloo API Integration

**User Story:** As the system, I want to integrate with Qloo's taste intelligence API, so that I can expand and enrich user interest data for better personalization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to enrich interest data THEN it SHALL call the Qloo API with the user's taste keywords
2. WHEN Qloo returns enriched concepts THEN the system SHALL process and utilize this data for matching
3. WHEN the Qloo API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to using original interest keywords
4. WHEN making Qloo API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and error handling

### Requirement 5: Personalized Coupon Matching

**User Story:** As a donor, I want to receive coupons and rewards that match my interests after making donations, so that I feel appreciated and motivated to continue donating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a donor completes a donation THEN the system SHALL trigger the reward matching process
2. WHEN matching rewards THEN the system SHALL use both original and Qloo-enriched interest data
3. WHEN a matching coupon is found THEN the system SHALL create a record in the donorcoupons table
4. WHEN a coupon is assigned THEN the system SHALL send a notification to the donor
5. IF no matching coupon is available THEN the system SHALL log this for future coupon creation

### Requirement 6: LLM Context Enhancement

**User Story:** As the system, I want to provide rich context to the LLM, so that it can generate more personalized and relevant responses for patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing an LLM prompt THEN the system SHALL include patient interests, conversation history, and system role context
2. WHEN the LLM processes the prompt THEN it SHALL generate responses that reference the patient's specific interests
3. WHEN multiple interests are provided THEN the LLM SHALL prioritize the most relevant ones based on the conversation context
4. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the LLM SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations related to the patient's interests

### Requirement 7: Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal interest data to be handled securely and privately, so that my information is protected and used only for improving my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing interest data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN accessing user interests THEN the system SHALL verify proper authentication and authorization
3. WHEN sharing data with third-party APIs THEN the system SHALL anonymize personally identifiable information
4. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove their interest data from all relevant tables

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the personalized features to respond quickly, so that my experience is smooth and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message is sent THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN processing donations for rewards THEN the system SHALL complete the matching process within 10 seconds
3. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain response times through proper caching and optimization
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized with appropriate indexes on taste_keywords fields
