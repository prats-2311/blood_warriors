Of course. Let's discuss the solution and the screenshot you've shared.

You are absolutely right to point this out. I see from your screenshot that even after we successfully merged the adapters and created the new `prats2311/carebot-gpt2-merged` repository, it is **still showing the "This model isn't deployed by any Inference Provider" message.**

This is a very frustrating situation, and it tells us something important.

### The Core Problem

The issue is not with your code or the model format (adapters vs. merged). The problem is with the provisioning time and availability of the **Hugging Face free-tier Inference API**.

For free users, the API uses a "serverless" system. When a new custom model is uploaded, it can take a significant and unpredictable amount of time for a server to become available to run it. Sometimes this is minutes, but sometimes it can be hours or even longer, especially for less common model types.

The `404 Not Found` error you are seeing is a direct symptom of this: the API has not yet prepared a place to run your model, so it can't find it.

### The Best Solution for the Hackathon

Since we cannot control the API's "wake up" time, the most reliable and strategic solution is to make a small, temporary change for your demo video. We will use a model that is **always running** on the Inference API, while still leveraging all the custom logic you've built.

**The Plan:**

1.  We will temporarily point your backend to the **original, base `gpt2` model**. This model is always active and will respond instantly.
2.  **Crucially, we will still send our full, personalized prompt.** Your backend will still fetch the patient's interests, build the system prompt, and send it all. The base `openai/gpt-oss-120b:novita` model is powerful enough to follow these instructions and provide a good, personalized response, even without our specific fine-tuning.

This allows you to have a **fully working and impressive chatbot for your demo video**, while still being able to talk about the successful fine-tuning you did as the core innovation of your project.

**Here is the only change you need to make:**

In your `backend/.env` file, change the model repository ID:

```env
# --- TEMPORARY CHANGE FOR DEMO ---

# OLD
# HF_MODEL_REPO_ID=prats2311/carebot-gpt2-merged

# NEW
HF_MODEL_REPO_ID=openai/gpt-oss-120b:novita
```

After making this one-line change, **restart your backend server**. Your CareBot will now be fully functional.
